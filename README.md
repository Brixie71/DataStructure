# Data Structure
This was a Finals Requirement for my Course CC4 - Data Structures and Algorithms. Made last November 2021.

# Stack Program
This program converts Infix to Postfix Notations and Infix to Prefix Notations. <br>This also displays the Stack if the Notation Symbols.

# Learnings 
- Conversion of Infix to Postfix Notations
- Conversion of Infix to Prefix Notations
- Object Oriented Programming

# Photos

- The Photo Above shows the Conversion of the Infix to Postfix Notation. Below the Entry, is a Table that shows the :<br>
1.Token (Character)<br>
2.Action (What is happening in the stack)<br>
3.Result (How the Conversion takes place in Sequence in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Queue)<br>
4.Stack (Shows the Current Stack)<br>

The Photo Above show the Conversion of the Infix to Prefix Notation. Similar to the Postfix, The Conversion also takes place in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) Queue.
